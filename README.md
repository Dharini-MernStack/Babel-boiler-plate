# Babel-boiler-plate
# Coding Challenge: Enhancing Planet Names Display

Instructions:

You are provided with an HTML file (index.html) and a JavaScript file (index.js) that create a simple web page displaying a list of planets in the Solar System.
Your task is to enhance the display of planet names using the pipeline operator and Babel's pipeline operator preset (pipeline-op).
Important Note: The pipeline operator (|>) is not natively supported in browsers and requires Babel's preset (pipeline-op) to function properly.
